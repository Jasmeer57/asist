ASIST: Antimicrobial Susceptibility standards


In the first column strain names will be mentioned, the second column will be left blank for getting resistance phenotype, starting two rows will comprise antibiotic names (first row) and antibiotic classes (second row). The data for the resistance profile will then start from the C3 column of an excel file which can be converted into a .csv file. Since B3 is left blank, after implementing the algorithm, column B3 will be filled with the resistance phenotype (susceptible, MDR, XDR, PDR).


First row of csv file : Strain name	Resistance_phenotype	A1	A2	A_N
Second row of csv file :		           Antibiotic Class
Third row of csv file : Strain_1	Phenotype_1	Resistant	Resistant	Resistant
nth row of csv file : Strain_2	Phenotype_2	Resistant	Susceptible	Resistant
